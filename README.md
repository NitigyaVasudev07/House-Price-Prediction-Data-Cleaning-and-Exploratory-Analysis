# House-Price-Prediction-Data-Cleaning-and-Exploratory-Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a real-world housing dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. The dataset includes property features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, floors, year built, location, condition, garage availability, and price.
🎯 Objectives:
Clean and standardize messy housing data

Handle missing values and incorrect entries

Engineer features for better model performance

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends and relationships in housing attributes

🧰 Tools Used:
Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn (optional for modeling)

🔧 Key Data Cleaning Tasks:
Replace or remove NaN and error_value entries

Normalize categorical values (e.g., location, condition)

Convert string-based booleans (e.g., "yes"/"no") to binary

Convert year and numeric fields to appropriate types

Detect and handle outliers in price and area

📊 Exploratory Insights:
Distribution of house prices across locations and conditions

Correlation between features like area, bedrooms, and price

Impact of garage availability and condition on pricing

Trends in housing development over time

📁 Output:
Cleaned dataset ready for machine learning

Visualizations that reveal key patterns in the housing market
